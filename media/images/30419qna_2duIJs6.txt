solution:

Brix value : TSS can be measured using either a Brix scale hydrometer or a refractometer and reported as “degrees Brix” (?Brix) which is equivalent to percentage (%). 
In principle, the unit ?Brix, which has been in common use in industry for many years, represents the dry substance content of solutions containing mainly sucrose
TSS or Brix represents the percentage by mass of total soluble solids of a pure aqueous sucrose solution 
For example, a juice sample that has 25 degree of Brix is assumed to contain 25 g of sugar/100 g of solution



NIR spectrscopy : in NIR spectroscopy both control and infested mangoes are subjected to pores using sterile sewing needle(0.4 mm diameter)


hyperspectral camera configuration is there in report of 2nd article of year 2017

MLR calibration model : Multiple linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two or more explanatory variables and a response variable by fitting a 
linear equation to observed data. Every value of the independent variable x is associated with a value of the dependent variable y.
